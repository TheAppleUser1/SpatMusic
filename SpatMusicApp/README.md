# SpatMusicApp

This is a simple MusicKit based example written in SwiftUI. It demonstrates a simplified user interface that addresses common complaints about Apple Music's design:

- **Simpler tab layout** with Library, Search and Now Playing only
- **Easier library sorting** via a sort picker
- **Accessible queue view** in the Now Playing screen

The project uses Swift Package Manager. To build open the folder in Xcode 15 or later and run on an iOS 15+ device.
