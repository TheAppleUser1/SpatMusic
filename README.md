# SpatMusic

SpatMusic is an experimental music player built with SwiftUI and MusicKit. The goal is to provide a clean interface that addresses many of the common UI criticisms directed at Apple Music.

## Key Design Improvements

- **Minimal tabs** – only Library, Search and Now Playing to reduce clutter.
- **Clear library sorting** – easily change sort order by title, artist or album.
- **Quick access to the queue** – see upcoming songs directly in the Now Playing screen.
- **Focus on your library** – avoid distracting recommendations by default.

See the [SpatMusicApp](SpatMusicApp/README.md) directory for the Swift package containing the sample code.
